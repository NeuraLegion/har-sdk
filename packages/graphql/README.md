Transform your [GraphQL introspection](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Introspection) or [GraphQL schema collection](https://spec.graphql.org/draft) into a series of [HAR request objects](http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/har-12-spec/#request). This can be useful for a variety of purposes, such as analyzing network performance and debugging web applications.

- Automatically generates fake data for all parameters
- Simple and easy-to-use API.
- Supports variety of community adopted [custom SCALAR](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Scalars.Custom-Scalars) types out of the box.
- Supports [GraphQL multipart request specification](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec).

With this library, you can easily generate requests with fake data to test your API using [AutoCannon](https://github.com/mcollina/autocannon#readme) or [DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/new-in-devtools-62/#har-imports).
